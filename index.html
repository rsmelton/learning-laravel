    <h1>My experience with Laravel, SQL, and ADF</h1>
    <p>To learn Laravel, I decided to build a pre-existing application that I had previously built using the MERN stack, but this time with Laravel.</p>
    <p>The app can be found here: <a href="https://dragons-brew-cafe-45mgn.sevalla.app">https://dragons-brew-cafe-45mgn.sevalla.app</a></p>

    <h4>App Features:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
            Registration and login with Laravel Breeze
        </li>
        <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
            User can add and remove items from their cart
        </li>
        <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
            Cart counter updates immediately to reflect users actions through the use of Alpine.js
        </li>
        <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
            Uses SQL database to store users and their respective cart items
        </li>
    </ul>

            About the MVC architecture of Laravel:
            <ul>
                <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
                    <span class="bold">Model</span>: File that represents an entity that will be stored in the database. Laravel uses Eloquent models meaning we can define relationships in these files that represent how entities interact with each other. Ex. A user can have many cart items while a cart item belongs to a user. 
                </li>
                <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
                    <span class="bold">View</span>: Simply what gets displayed to the user through Blade comonents. Blade components are essentially just reusable components to be used in the frontend of the application.
                </li>
                <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
                    <span class="bold">Controller</span>: Handles the heavy lifting of the application whether thats calculations, database queries, or handling requests from the frontend and providing a response.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            How to write SQL queries:
            <p>While these are basic examples, I didn't need very complex queries in this application.</p>
            <span class="bold">Outside the code</span>:
            <ul>
                <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
                    Ex. Get all users: SELECT * FROM users;
                </li>
                <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
                    Ex. Get specific users cart items: SELECT * FROM cart_items WHERE id = 1;
                </li>
            </ul>
            <span class="bold">Inside the code</span>:
            <ul>
                <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
                    Ex. Grabbing all the authenticated users cart items: $userCartItems = CartItem::where('user_id', auth()->id())->get();
                </li>
                <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
                    Ex. Checks to see if a specific menu item already exists in the users cart to know whether to create the new item, or to simply increment its quantity: $existingCartItem = CartItem::where('user_id', $userId)
                                    ->where('menu_item_id', $menuItemId)
                                    ->first();
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>ADF:</h4>
    <p>While it didn't make any sense to use ADF in this application, I figured it would still be a good idea to try and get a better understanding of how it works.</p>
    <p>The way I understood it well was by understanding this analogy: Imagine a chocolate factory and we have a manager and this manager is responsible for gathering the needed resources to make the chocolate. Once the manager has all the resources he can then pass those resources off to the workers and these workers can clean, mix, and wrap the chocolate. Once we have the chocolate we can then send it off to our store. Using this analogy we can understand that our resources could be different types of files that hold data. The manager is ADF and ADF passes off these files to its workers to clean the data or complete other activities. Once these activities are completed we can then transfer the data to be loaded into our database. Another easy way to remember this is that ADF uses ETL or Extract, Transfer, Load.</p>
