    <h1>My experience with Laravel, SQL, and ADF</h1>
    <p>To learn Laravel, I decided to build a pre-existing application that I had previously built using the MERN stack, but this time with Laravel.</p>
    <p>The app can be found <a href="https://dragons-brew-cafe-45mgn.sevalla.app">here</a> (the app may take a few seconds to spin up, so if an error page appears click refresh after about 5-10 seconds)</p>

    <h4>App Features:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
            Registration and login with Laravel Breeze
        </li>
        <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
            User can add and remove items from their cart
        </li>
        <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
            Cart counter updates immediately to reflect users actions through the use of Alpine.js
        </li>
        <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
            Uses SQL database to store users and their respective cart items
        </li>
    </ul>

            About the MVC architecture of Laravel:
            <ul>
                <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
                    <span class="bold">Model</span>: File that represents an entity that will be stored in the database. Laravel uses Eloquent models, meaning we can define relationships in these files that represent how entities interact with each other. Ex. A user can have many cart items while a cart item belongs to a user. 
                </li>
                <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
                    <span class="bold">View</span>: Simply what gets displayed to the user through Blade comonents. Blade components are essentially just reusable components to be used in the frontend of the application.
                </li>
                <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
                    <span class="bold">Controller</span>: Handles the heavy lifting of the application (calculations, database queries, or handling requests from the frontend and providing a response).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
            How to write SQL queries:
            <p>While these are basic examples, I didn't need very complex queries in this application.</p>
            <span class="bold">Outside the code</span>:
            <ul>
                <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
                    Ex. Get all users: SELECT * FROM users;
                </li>
                <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
                    Ex. Fetching cart items for a specific user: SELECT * FROM cart_items WHERE id = 1;
                </li>
            </ul>
            <span class="bold">Inside the code</span>:
            <ul>
                <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
                    Ex. Fetching cart items for authenticated user: $userCartItems = CartItem::where('user_id', auth()->id())->get();
                </li>
                <li class="summary-li-padding-bottom summary-li-indentation">
                    Ex. Checks to see if a specific menu item already exists in the user's cart to know whether to create the new item, or to simply increment its quantity: $existingCartItem = CartItem::where('user_id', $userId)->where('menu_item_id', $menuItemId)->first();
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Azure Data Factory (ADF):</h4>
    <p>While it didn't make any sense to use ADF in this application, I figured it would still be a good idea to try and get a better understanding of how it works.</p>
    <p>The best way I understood it was through this analogy:</p>
    <p class="bold" style="margin-bottom: -0.75rem;">Imagine a chocolate factory.</p>
    <p>There is a manager whose job is to gather all the resources needed to make chocolate. Once the manager collects everything, he hands those resources to the workers, who clean, mix, and wrap the chocolate. After the chocolate is prepared, it’s sent to the store.</p>
    <p>Using this analogy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The resources represent different types of files that hold data.</li>
        <li>The manager represents Azure Data Factory (ADF).</li>
        <li>The workers represent the various ADF activities that clean, transform, or process the data.</li>
        <li>Once the workers finish, the final product (the processed data) is loaded into the database.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-bottom: -0.75rem;">Another simple way to remember this:</p>
    <p class="bold">ADF performs ETL — Extract, Transform, Load.</p>
    <!-- <p>The way I understood it well was by understanding this analogy: Imagine a chocolate factory and we have a manager and this manager is responsible for gathering the needed resources to make the chocolate. Once the manager has all the resources he can then pass those resources off to the workers and these workers can clean, mix, and wrap the chocolate. Once we have the chocolate we can then send it off to our store. Using this analogy we can understand that our resources could be different types of files that hold data. The manager is ADF and ADF passes off these files to its workers to clean the data or complete other activities. Once these activities are completed we can then transfer the data to be loaded into our database. Another easy way to remember this is that ADF uses ETL or Extract, Transfer, Load.</p> -->

    <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">That's it! Thanks for taking the time to read about everything I have learned and if you have any questions please feel free to email me, call me, or we could even have lunch in Birmingham since we are both local. Thanks Lance!</p>
